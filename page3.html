    <h1><p>VELIVIRATTU </h1>In this variant the approach is slightly different as the bull is directly released into open ground. The rules are the same as that of vadi majuviraṭṭu. This is a popular variant in the districts of Sivagangai and Madurai.</p>
    <h1><p>In popular culture</h1>
        Jallikattu is often shown in Tamil cinema where the hero tames the bull to prove his gallantry.[79] Some of the popular films include:
        
        Aravaan[80]
        Cheran Pandiyan
        Ilami[81]
        Kanni Paruvathile
        Mann Vasanai
        Mirugam - The movie was released after cutting the jallikattu scene due to objections by the Censor Board[82][83]
        Murattu Kaalai[79]
        Rajakumaran
        Thaikku pin Tharam
        Vilaiyaattu Pillai[84]
